# Free Assets Library by Biochemist

I compiled a List of assets from unreleased and old stuff i did for others to use. I Licensed it under GPLv3
The only change to the License is, that if you're using the Assets without modifying them (or only editing them slightly)
then just make sure, you mention my name somewhere.

These Assets were originially intended to be used by some minecraft mods i wrote and also contain most of the stuff
from my Minecraft Texture Pack *Biocraft*. But since i'm active in the MineTest Community now, it made sense to open
up that stuff, for everyone to use (especially, because they're old anyways)

I tried to clear unedited Files or graohics not made by me from this collection, and also didn't include some stuff, where
i wasnt sure, in some cases stuff was combined with unedited graphics. If you encounter such a case, just make sure, you
don't use it, or just let me know, so i can update/remove them. These unedited files obviously fall under their original authors
permission, such as:


- Minecraft,
- Buildcraft,
- IndustricalCraft2
- ComputerCraft,
- and more...


### If you liked the stuff, you found, feel free to star this repo, would be nice to see, that other folks do cool things with it
### Enjoy!
